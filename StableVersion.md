Daisy have been significantly changed since 4.01, the most significant being (optional) support for 2D geometries.  These changes have mostly stabilized by now, so we no longer recommend version 4.01.  Currently, we recommend new users to get the latest version.

You can still [fetch version 4.01 here](http://daisy-model.googlecode.com/files/Daisy%204.01.zip).

Note that the MS Windows installer was not written back then, so you have to unpack the archive yourself.  Version 4.01 of "sample" and "lib" directories are also included, as well as version 4.00 of the reference manual and tutorial.

In general we recommend that people who work closely with us get the latest version which we can provide the best support for, while people who work more independently should stick with the stable version.
