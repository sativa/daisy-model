DHI owns the groundwater model [MIKE SHE](MikeShe.md), with which Daisy can communicate through [OpenMI](OpenMI.md).  [We](Agrohydrology.md) have been collaborating with DHI in many projects.  DHI also owns [DaisyGIS](DaisyGIS.md), a graphical user interface for Daisy that is particularly well suited for combination with GIS data.
