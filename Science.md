While the Daisy software is described in the bundled documentation, the scientific description of the models included in Daisy is spread in various scientific publication.

## Scientific publications ##

The original publication:

  * Hansen, Søren, Henry E. Jensen, Niels Erik Nielsen, and Henrik Svendsen (1991). _Simulation of Nitrogen Dynamics and Biomass Production in Winter Wheat using the Danish Simulation model Daisy_. In: Fertilizer Research 27, pp. 245-259.

The 2000 C++ rewrite, with emphasize on a more flexible model architecture:

  * Abrahamsen, Per and Søren Hansen (Mar. 2000).  _Daisy: An Open Soil-Crop-Atmosphere Model_. In: Environmental Modelling and Software 15.3, pp. 313-330.

The most recent overview, with emphasis on use cases:

  * Hansen, Søren., Per Abrahamsen, Carsten T. Petersen, and Merete Styczen (2012). _Daisy: Model use, calibration, and validation_. Trans. ASABE 55(4): 1315-1333.

See [the Daisy bibliography](Literature.md) for additional (mostly external) references.

## Some on-site sources ##

  * Daisy was originally described in [NAEP](NAEP.md) report [A10](A10.md), and this is still the most complete single scientific description of the model.
  * A newer but less complete [description of Daisy](DaisyDescription.md) was later started, but never finished.  It does contain good information of many never features.
  * A description of the [2D transport numeric algoritms](http://daisy-model.googlecode.com/files/Num2D-v2.pdf).
  * [Preferential flow in Daisy - for tile drained soil](R2D2.md).
