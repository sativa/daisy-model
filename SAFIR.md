# SAFIR #

SAFIR is an [EU](EU.md) project to help provide _saf\_e_ir\_rigation.

The two main components of this project is
  1. health issues related to use of low quality water for irrigation.
  1. use of [partial rootzone drying](PRD.md) (PRD) for conserving water.

Some Daisy related tasks include:

  1. Support for row crops, including a [2D root density](GP2D.md) model.
  1. Two dimensional soil description.
  1. One or more tomato parameterization
  1. A [Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transpher](SVAT.md) (SVAT) model.
  1. Much more.

The documentation can be found on the [SAFIR home page](http://www.safir4eu.org/) in the deliverables linked to below.
