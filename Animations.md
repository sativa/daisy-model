# Introduction #

Animations from different Daisy projects. The movies available for viewing are very compressed. Thus it is possible to make animations of higher quality.


# 1D movement of water and solute #

In the simulations is winter barley grown in to different soils: A sandy and a clayey soil. The winter barley is grown under typical Danish conditions. The weather used is from the Copenhagen University Agrohydrology Climate Station in Taastrup.


## Water movement ##

The two first graphs shows the water content in the upper 250 cm of a sandy and a clayey soil respectively. The last graph shows the precipitation during the year.

## NO3 movement ##

The two first graphs shows the nitrate concentration in the upper 250 cm of a sandy and clayey soil respectively. The last graph shows the precipitation during the year.
