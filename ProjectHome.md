# Daisy #

If you are new here, you may want to start reading our short [overview of Daisy](About.md) and then maybe the page about [getting started](GettingStarted.md).  Scientists may then proceed to our page with [scientific descriptions](Science.md) of the model, while people who work on Danish environmental applications may proceed to the Danish language page about [standardized use](DanskStandard.md) for environmental permits.

You can fetch the latest development version of Daisy by following the download link under the News section below.  You can get other old versions by searching for [Deprecated Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/downloads/list?can=4&q=) in the [Downloads tab](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/downloads/list).

## News ##

**Note:** Daisy is still under active development, but this page is no longer updated. However, the current [NEWS](https://github.com/perabrahamsen/daisy-model/blob/master/NEWS) and [ChangeLog](https://github.com/perabrahamsen/daisy-model/blob/master/ChangeLog) are still updated.

**Note:** When a new home for Daisy is found, it will be announced on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/daisy-model) but we may not be able to update this page.

**Note:** Currently, [new versions of Daisy can be found here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9TbMb_42mTJSE92MWQxWDluU2s&usp=sharing). As of writing, all the binaries are for 64 bit MS Windows. 32 bit MS Windows versions should return soon.

## Content ##

Most of the content of this site is accessible from the pages listed under the Wiki tab. These pages can roughly be divided into the following categories:

  * [Structural](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Structure) pages, helping organize the other pages and the downloads.
  * [On-site descriptions](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Subject-Daisy) of Daisy, targeted at different groups, as well as links to external [papers](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Subject-Paper) and [demonstrations](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Subject-Demo).
  * [People](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Subject-Person), [projects](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Subject-Project) and [organizations](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Subject-Organization) associated with Daisy.
  * [Releases](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Subject-Release) of the Daisy software.
  * Information for [programmers](Programmers.md) about the [source code](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Subject-Code).
  * And finally, various [utilities](http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/w/list?q=label:Subject-Utility) that might be relevant for Daisy users.

Not all stuff has been moved here yet, so you might want to visit our [old home page](http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~daisy/index-old.html) as well.
