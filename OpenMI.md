# OpenMI #

OpenMI is a C# framework for coupling hydraulic simulation models.  Support for OpenMI was added to Daisy in the [SAFIR](SAFIR.md) project, where it was used both for coupling with [MIKE SHE](MikeShe.md) and for communicating with a project specific management model.  The [SAFIR](SAFIR.md) page have links to documentation.
